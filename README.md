ðŸ‘‹ Hola, I write interfaces for the web. 

Currently working with financial data, helping pro users navigate streams of data on dashboards and tables on a React/Typescript codebase. 
My dev ðŸ”¥ take is that Redux is the only dependency I'll fight for it to stay in the project for many years to come. 

My team enjoy working with me so most likely you will too.
