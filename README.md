ðŸ‘‹ Hola, I write interfaces for the web. 

Currently working with financial data, helping pro users navigate streams of data on dashboards and tables on a React/Typescript codebase. 
My dev ðŸ”¥ take is that Redux is the only dependency I'll fight for it to stay in the project for many years to come. 

Experienced in CSS as I started customizing my [Tumblr](https://storyteller.tumblr.com/) and been using it wildly for years now.
